Optimizing Energy Consumption through Data-Driven Analytics for eSC


Abstract:
This report describes a joint venture between a team of data analysts and eSC, a forward-thinking energy company dedicated to sustainable energy delivery. The main objective was to create a service based on data analytics to optimize energy consumption, especially during high-demand periods in summer. Through sophisticated data analytics and predictive modeling, the project sought to improve eSC's operational effectiveness and commitment to environmental sustainability, without major new capital expenditures. The outcomes from the data analysis and models suggest considerable potential for energy conservation and enhanced management of energy demand, which supports wider environmental objectives.


Introduction:
The escalating global temperatures have underscored the importance of energy management for both sustainability and operational effectiveness. In response, eSC collaborated with data analysts to harness sophisticated data analytics techniques to refine energy consumption optimization. This endeavor is in sync with international efforts to tackle climate change, epitomizing a proactive strategy towards intelligent energy management. The primary aims of this project were to dissect energy usage trends, forecast peak demand periods, and devise strategies for energy consumption that are both effective and based on analytic insights. The collaboration also aimed to integrate renewable energy sources more effectively into the existing grid, thereby reducing reliance on non-renewable resources. Additionally, by understanding consumption patterns, eSC hopes to influence consumer behavior towards more energy-efficient practices, further contributing to environmental and economic sustainability.


Methodology:
The methodology employed in this project included the collection and encryption of comprehensive datasets, which covered static housing data and hourly weather patterns from several counties across the Carolinas. This information detailed the characteristics of the buildings and the specific types of energy consumption, and it was supplemented by additional metadata related to weather and energy. A meticulous data cleansing process was carried out to refine these datasets for analytical purposes, concentrating on relevant building IDs and specific counties. The core of the data analysis involved the integration of two primary datasets: housing data and energy usage data, which were merged based on building ID and county parameters, enabling an in-depth examination of energy consumption trends. Additional steps included the integration of temporal data to examine energy usage fluctuations over time and the application of advanced filtering techniques to isolate significant patterns and anomalies. This comprehensive approach not only enhanced the accuracy of the analysis but also allowed for more targeted energy management recommendations.


Results:
In the results section, the merged datasets afforded a holistic perspective on energy consumption patterns across various building types and environmental conditions. The statistical analysis pointed out that electricity and natural gas were the chief sources of energy, with minimal contributions from other types. The use of visual analytics illuminated discrepancies in energy usage among different counties and building types, pinpointing areas where energy efficiency could be markedly improved. Additionally, the execution of R code facilitated not only the data cleaning and merging processes but also the application and demonstration of predictive modeling techniques, specifically Generalized Linear Models (GLM) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The outputs from these models were crucial in refining our understanding and predictions of energy consumption trends. Furthermore, the results were dynamically displayed using Shiny applications, providing interactive visualizations that effectively communicated the findings and underscored the practical implications of the data-driven insights.
